* your noted down ChipID of the ESP8266 (NodeMCU) 
* your email address (will not be published)
* your address: Street with house number, postcode and city. Click on "Lookup entered address" to get the location coordinates (will be rounded off). Check the position of the pin, change it if needed 
* internal name makes it easier to separate if you have multiple sensors (like garden, sensor for mom,...)
* the surroundings of the station - e.g. height above ground, side of the road, high traffic volume, free field or similar

> #### By the way!
> Currently it is not possible to register using the site both PM sensor, temp/humidity and DNMS sensor connected to one NodeMCU. For now it can only be done manually by sending a request to tech (at) sensor.community. See [issue](https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart/sensor.community/issues/117) for details.
